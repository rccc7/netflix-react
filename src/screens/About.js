                <h2 className="about__h2">Brief Description:</h2>
                <p className='about__p'>This application was developed with the purpose of making a UI similar
                    to Netflix by implementing ReactJs components, Redux, Firebase,
                    as well as other react hooks and components.
                    The movie posters, thumbnails, and descriptions are dynamically retrieved from TMDB
                    through its API and react-axios component.
                    The movies are classified by the following categories: Netflix Originals, trending,
                    top rated, action, comedy, horror, romance, and documentaries.
                    There is also the functionality to watch the corresponding YouTube trailers when
                    clicking on a thumbnail, (as long as the corresponding movie has an
                    associated trailer specified in the TMDB database). It is fully responsive,
                    since components are arranged applying flexbox layout. Every time the page is
                    refreshed., the banner at the top displays a random movie along with its
                    description. Users can sign in and sign out, and there is a profile section
                    (accessed by clicking on the avatar icon) in
                    which the user information is displayed along with the current plan and
                    available plans to upgrade.</p>
                <h2 className="about__h2">Components and libraries used:</h2>
                <p className="about__p">The following components and libraries were used:</p>
                <h2 className='about__h2'></h2>

                        In this implementation, Redux is used to maintain registered user access
                        throughout the application, so that every time the page is refreshed or
                        the user closes the window and opens it again, the current user is
                        retrieved from the data layer until the user logs out.

                            and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
